// Prototyping-OOP
/*
When someone says "Object Oriented" they mean something dependent on objects.  
JavaScript is a "functional" language, but has a lot of object oriented aspects to it.

When you call a method on an object and the method uses the keyword "this", "this" refers to the object you're 
calling the method on (the variable before the dot).
