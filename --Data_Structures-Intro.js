                                    Intro

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract data types and data structures are fundamental to general computer science, 
and are also a great way to better understand object-oriented programming (OOP).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract Data Type (ADT)

        An ADT is a description of information, how that information is connected, 
        and performable operations on the information. 
        
        For example:
        
                a list is an ordered collection of elements, which you can add to or read from.
                
                A dictionary is a set of key-value pairs, where you can get or set a value 
                (e.g. "Emily") by key (e.g. "name"). 
                
        Notice that an ADT says nothing about programs, memory, steps, etc. — it's just a concept.


Data Structure (DS)

        A DS on the other hand is a specific programmatic solution for storing, referencing, 
        and accessing data in computer memory. 
        
        The purpose of a data structure is to implement some ADT — 
        
        for example: 
        
                take the concept of a "list" and realize it in actual code 
                (place such-and-such data at this memory address, increment a variable, etc.).

        Often an ADT can be implemented via more than one DS. 
        Since different DSs have advantages and disadvantages from functionality 
        and performance standpoints, it is beneficial to have a solid understanding of how they work.

Also, the workshop includes references to the following Abstract Data Types (ADT) and Data Structures (DS), 
which you may optionally elect to research on your own time:

Queue ADT
Stack ADT
Array DS
Circular Buffer DS
Linked List DS
Association List DS
Associative Array / Map / Dictionary ADT
Hash Table DS
Binary Search Tree DS
