// Summary discussion on loops....


//-------------------------------
/*For loops:

Remember to use them when you have a set amount of things to iterate through.  
Have a starting & ending position.  Typically use this when you have a flat datatype like a string or an array.
Most of the time you will be using .length (there are exceptions to this).

The structure is:

    for ( initialize the loop ; chk to continue the loop ; after each iteration update the loop ) 
                  { some code to do stuff };
*/
    for(let i=0, i< arr.length, I++){
        console.log('hello!')
    };
