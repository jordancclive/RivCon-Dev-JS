                             Type Coercion

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript is a loosely typed language.  
Meaning that variables are declared without a type.

Datatypes are derived internally by JavaScript.  
...and can change internally.

Which brings us to Type Coercion.  
javascript will try to make sense out of what you are doing and try to 
come up with a result....as follows:

        4 + 5 = 9
        "a" + "b" = "ab"
        'a' + 5 = "a5"            <----
        'a' + [1,2,3] = 'a1,2,3'  <----
