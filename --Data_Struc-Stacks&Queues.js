                                Stacks & Queues

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stacks:

        Like a stack of books stacked on a desk.  You stack them from bottom to top
        and you remove them from top to bottom.
        
              - Elements are sorted in insertion order
              - Last in, first out
              - Elements have no index
              - Can only add to the top and remove from the top.  (push in & pop out)             
              
              - Useful when you want to reverse the order of elements.  (undo on your computer)
              
Queues

        A single file line.
        
              - Have a front and a back.
              - Can add to the back and remove from the front.  
              - adding: enqueueing and removing: ddequeueing
              
              - elements are sorted by insertion order
              - FIFO
              - Elements have no index
              - Can only add to back and remove from front.
              
              - A print queue.
