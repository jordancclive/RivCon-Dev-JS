                      Deploying your repository

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can easily deploy your repository using GitHub Pages. 

To do this, make sure you have pushed your changes up to either 
your fork of the repository or your own project repository.

Then, go into the settings tab for your repository. 

About half-way down the page, you'll see the 'Pages' options. 

Under 'Source' select the branch that you want to deploy. 

For most of you, this will be the 'master' branch. Once you select a branch, 
your game will be deployed to https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/PROJECTNAME.
