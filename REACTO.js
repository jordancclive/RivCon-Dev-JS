// Steps to answering a problem in an interview:  REACTO

/*

Will not be able to run your code during the interview.  
Will write code without checking things out.  Will write the code in a text document.

You will probably have 15 minutes to do the problem, so you will not have a bunch of time.

They will be looking for how you do things.

Step 1:  Repeat the problem back to them.  Validate that you heard them correctly.
          This also helps you conceptualize the problem.          ..................might take 15 seconds.  (R)

Step 2:  Give Examples of possible inputs and expected outputs.  [1,2,3] result: 6
          avoid edge cases at this point.
          Might want to state your assumptions                    .................might take 15-20seconds  (E)                  

Step 3:   Approach.  How you will go about solving the problem.
            ....These are the steps you will follow.
            Step 1...
            Step 2...
            Step 3...                                             ........might take 45 seconds - 1 minute  (A)

Step 4:   Code your solution.                                     ....will take 65% of the time.            (C)
                                                                          8-10 minutes?
Step 5: Test/Validate manually that you know things are correct.                                            (T)

Step 6: If you have time, optimize the solution and/or deal with edge cases.                                (O)
                                                                  ....30 seconds to a minute for this
