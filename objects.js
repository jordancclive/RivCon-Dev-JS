/* Objects

Look at objects as a bag of keys ("strings") and when you pull out a key (or know a particular key)(use a key), you can access 
that key's values. So we have a bunch of doors and these keys open the door to the values inside.  Unless we have that key, we
can't access the value. ......Key : Value.    .....key (===property) : Value.

As an example:  If you go to a dictionary (an object is similar to a dictionary).  You would go to a word in the dictionary 
(The Key or the property) and then you can see the definition (Value for the word).

              var dictionary = {                        <----  the braces tell JS that this variable is an object and the 
                  sunny: "cheerful, optimistic",                contents (property: value pairs) are within the curly braces.
                  design: "contrive, devise"            <----  property: "value" or "value1, value2..."
              };
