                Cloning &/or Forking a Repository

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Start with clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.

        - The system will ask you where you want to put it.  --->generally select your account.
        
The system will create a copy of the entire repository in your account.

Once you have a fork (a copy), you will want to clone it to your local computer.

        - select "clone" and copy the HTTPS link listed. 
        
On the Terminal/Console:
        
        Create a general container folder ---> "Foundations" to designate Fullstack repositories.

        Now clone within this Directory the "fork" by typing the following command:  git clone <HTTPS link>
        This does a couple of things:
        
                - First:    It creates a folder containing that project.
                
                - Second:   Within this folder, it has a git reposotory initiated.  (git init) & (.git directory) done.
                
                - Third:    It sets the (git remote) called (origin) to point to your remote fork on github.com
                
                            If you do a (git remote -v)
                            result:  https links pointing to your fork.

At this point you can make some changes to the repository using the text editor "sublime" as an example.

        Type the command:     subl .
