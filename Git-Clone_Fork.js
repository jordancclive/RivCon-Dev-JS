                Cloning &/or Forking a Repository

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Start with clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.

        - The system will ask you where you want to put it.  --->generally select your account.
        
The system will create a copy of the entire repository in your account.

Once you have a fork (a copy), you will want to clone it to your local computer.

        - select "clone" and copy the HTTPS link listed. 
        
On the Terminal/Console:
        
        Create a general container folder ---> "Foundations" to designate Fullstack repositories.

        Now clone the "fork" by typing the following command:  git clone <HTTPS link>
