// The Monster Game (simple)
/*
    assumptions:
    
    want a class called monsters.  They will has health, attack and defence.
    want 2 methods:
      
      - restore health resets health to 100 or full health
      - get attacked:  takes in an attack as a parameter
                       and when a monster gets attacked does some calculation
                       with monsters defence and makes some change to health.
      
      Ex: (4* attack from person attacking) - (2* defence of monster being attacked)
          gets subtracted from health.
    
    going to have a monster constructor
    2 methods
