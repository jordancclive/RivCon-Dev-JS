                        Testem - running specs
                        
                        
                     Uploading git changes to github

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the specs for a directory, you need to go into that directory and run the command testem.

                    $ testem
                    TEST'EM 'SCRIPTS!
                    Open the URL below in a browser to connect.
                    http://localhost:7357/



Even though we will not be grading your TestFirst assignments, we encourage you to commit your work and push your commits up to your fork of TestFirst-Checkpoint-Prep-Part-1.

                    $git add .
                    $git commit -m 'your commit message'
                    $git push origin master



Not only is this good practice for you, but you will need to push your work up to GitHub in this manner when you take your Checkpoints so that they can be graded. Get used to using Git now before you start your Checkpoints! If you are lost, please consult the 'Exploring Git' section of this workshop, or post your questions on Discuss or the Help Desk.
