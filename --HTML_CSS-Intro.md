                        HTML & CSS Intro

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition:

    HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, 
    for example, headings, paragraphs, or images. 

    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of content—using, 
    for example, fonts or colors.
    
    ex:  <a>

HTML terms:

    Elements

        Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. 
        
        Some of the more frequently used elements include multiple levels of headings 
        (identified as <h1> through <h6> elements) and paragraphs (identified as the <p> element); 
        the list goes on to include the <a>, <div>, <span>, <strong>, and <em> elements, and many more.

        Elements are identified by the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets, 
        < >, surrounding the element name.
        
    Tags

        The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a tag. 
        Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags.

        An opening tag marks the beginning of an element. 
        It consists of a less-than sign followed by an element’s name, 
        and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, <div>.

        A closing tag marks the end of an element. It consists of a less-than sign 
        followed by a forward slash and the element’s name, 
        and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, </div>.

        The content that falls between the opening and closing tags is the content of that element. 
        An anchor link, for example, will have an opening tag of <a> and a closing tag of </a>. 
        What falls between these two tags will be the content of the anchor link.

        So, anchor tags will look a bit like this:  <a>...</a>

    Attributes

        Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element. 
        
        The most common attributes include the id attribute, which identifies an element; 
        the class attribute, which classifies an element; 
        the src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content; 
        and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource.

        Attributes are defined within the opening tag, after an element’s name. 
        
        Generally attributes include a name and a value. 
        The format for these attributes consists of the attribute name followed by an equals sign 
        and then a quoted attribute value. 
        
        For example, an <a> element including an href attribute would look like the following:
        
            <a href="http://shayhowe.com/">Shay Howe</a>
