/*

Null:

  You have defined a variable and you know what Data Type it is, but have not given it a value. 
  It is a placeholder for a variable's value.  A variable that has no value yet.

Undefined:

  You have no idea what the Data Type is for this variable yet.  The variable has been declared, but it is an unused variable.

String:

  text, always wrapped with quotes.

Numbers:

  Are numbers with all the same characteristics of numbers in the real world.  (You can perform operations on them).
  
  64 bits, 1 bit is +/-, a few store the decimal point.  Fractional digital numbers are approximate.

Boolean:

  A value of True or False.  ....takes the least amount of memory. (1 bit  --> 0 or 1).

Function:

  Chunk of reusable code.

Object:

  A specific type of Object is an Array.




Symbol:  New Data Type

  It is a primitive Data type.

=================================

Special Values:

        Infinity, -Infinity
        
        NaN
        
=================================

Precedence:

        1. *, /, %(mod)
        
        2. +, -

=================================

Primitive Data Type vs. Complex Data Type.

  Primitive Data Type takes up a specific amount of memory.
    
    Examples:   Numbers (They are assigned a specific set of bits to store them and a maximum # that can be used.)
                Booleans take up 1 bit of memory and are Primitive.  
                Strings.
  
  Complex Data Types do not use a finite amount of memory.  The amount of memory used can be changed. 
  ...and can change over the Data Types use (this is the most important thing to remember).

    Examples:   Objects, Functions, Arrays.
    
=================================

What is a higher order language?   ....You have a lot of flexibility with the language.  
You can pass functions as variables and treat them like any other variable.  
(JavaScript is a high order language)
