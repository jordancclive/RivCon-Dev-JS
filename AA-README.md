# JavaScript
testing new concepts here...        ...This is a teaching repository for JavaScript. 

Quick notes: 

Why is JavaScript a high order language?  
...All datatypes (including functions) can be passed as an input argument and/or output return value. 

put ----> 'use strict';  <---- in your code (at the beginning) and any JavaScript compiler will 
utilize the ES2015 ES6 compiler when it runs your code.

Deep inspection of something:   console.dir(x)  
            ---> x = an object like an array you declared in your code.  see:  prototypes-OOP.js  around line 100+.
