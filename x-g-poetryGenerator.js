// Project:  build a poetry generator

/*
Generator will do 2 things:
    1. Generate something complete based on a word corpus (no fill-in-the-blanks)  (???)
    2. Train itself to write poetry based on a Markov Chain.                       (???)

Our poetry generator will consume a corpus text it will model it's output poetry on. 
Create a function that parses a multiline string and returns an array of the words in the string, 
uniformly formatted with no numbers or punctuation.

You may accomplish this using a series of loops or with a regular expression
