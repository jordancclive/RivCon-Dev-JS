                                Stacks & Queues

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stacks:

        Like a stack of books stacked on a desk.  You stack them from bottom to top
        and you remove them from top to bottom.
        
              - Elements are sorted in insertion order
              - Last in, first out
              - Elements have no index
              - Can only add to the top and remove from the top.  (push in & pop out)             
              
              - Useful when you want to reverse the order of elements.  (undo on your computer)
              
Queues

        A single file line.
        
              - Have a front and a back.
              - Can add to the back and remove from the front.  
              - adding: enqueueing and removing: ddequeueing
              
              - elements are sorted by insertion order
              - FIFO
              - Elements have no index
              - Can only add to back and remove from front.
              
              - A print queue.

                               Linked Lists

A List:

        Dictionary: A number of connected items or names written or printed consecutively.

        In Computer Science:  
                
                an ordered collection of values (aka: items, entries, elements)
                
                Where a value may occur more than once.
                
A linked List:  

        A sequence of nodes where one is a reference and the other is a reference to the next item on the list.
        
        The list ends with a reference pointer of null.
        
        Usually there is an extra reference that points to the beginning called 'head'
              
Behavior:

        You can add and remove an element.
        
        find an element and do operations on elements
        
        
How are they implemented:

        - Arrays or Linked Lists.
        
        The problem with arrays is when you have to add an element in the middle of the list.  
        You have to shift the elements down to make room.
        
        An array's size is fixed after you create it.
